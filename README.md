# StageHostels-System
StageHostels is a system for booking rooms around the university by the students(Users).
The system will help Moi university students to book for themselves residential houses around the university as opposed to the usual and previous way, where the students are forced to travel to the university a week or days prior to the official opening dates. 
The system will thus save the students the stress of walking around as they will just be able to comfortably book themselves residential houses while at home before the official opening dates.
The students will be able to view the hostels available for booking and their rooms, details of the rooms(rent, images, caretaker name and contact).
