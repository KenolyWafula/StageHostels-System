                            <h4><u> Our Motivation</u></h4>
                            <p>Moi University has a very accessible area of settlement. 
                            This is the case as it is near the universityâ€™s premises. There are places of settlement outside the school which are owned by private entrepreneurs that are rented by students and a few locals. Due to the continuing growth in population of the students in the university, a couple of factors emerge; both positive and negative.
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                            <li> Due to the increased number of students in the university, there is also a need for increased areas of settlement for the students.</li>
                            <li> university hostels can only accommodate just but a fraction of whole population</li>
                            <li>A large number of students are forced to look for private areas of residence. </li>
                            <li>Students are also forced to travel all the way from their homes around the country; and at times out of the country, early enough before the semester starts, in order to book and get a place in these private areas of residence</li>
                            <li>The areas of settlement are few bringing lots of monetary and time challenges.</li>
                            <li>It is convenient</li>
                            </ul>
